HerobrineAlive
==============

Add Herobrine to PocketMine-MP! (Alpha_1.4.0+ ONLY)

Installation
==============

This plugin is still being developed and can not be installed.

Usage
==============

The main command is /HerobrineAlive, and there are 3 different subcommands:
- RELEASE: releases herobrine
- KILL: kills herobrine
- ATTACK [player]: attacks player specified

So for example _/HerobrineAlive ATTACK playername_ gives Herobrine the command to attack playername, but it only works if he is released.
